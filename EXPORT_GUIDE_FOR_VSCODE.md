# 📱 Complete Project Export for VS Code

## 🎯 You have 3 options to get this project:

---

## ✅ **OPTION 1: Auto Setup Script (FASTEST - 2 minutes)**

### For Mac/Linux:

1. **Create a new folder and open terminal:**
   ```bash
   mkdir bidding-marketplace
   cd bidding-marketplace
   ```

2. **Download the setup script I created:**
   - Copy the entire content from `/setup.sh` file (in this Figma Make project)
   - Save it as `setup.sh` in your folder

3. **Run it:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### For Windows (PowerShell):

1. **Create a new folder:**
   ```powershell
   mkdir bidding-marketplace
   cd bidding-marketplace
   ```

2. **I'll give you a Windows version - say "Windows script"**

## ✅ **OPTION 2: Look for Export in Figma Make**

Your Figma Make interface should have an export button. Common locations:

### **Check these spots:**

**1. Top-right corner:**
- "Download" button
- "Export Code" button
- "Download ZIP" button
- Three dots menu (⋮) → Export

**2. Top menu bar:**
- "File" → "Download" or "Export"
- "Share" → "Download as ZIP"

**3. Right-click in file explorer:**
- Right-click on root folder
- Look for "Download" or "Export"

### **What you're looking for:**
- Any button that says: Download, Export, Get Code, Download ZIP
- It will give you all ~80 files as a ZIP

**Can you see any of these?** If yes, click it!

## 🚀 **Which Option Do You Want?**

Tell me:

**A)** "Give me the auto setup script" → I'll provide the complete script

**B)** "Show me how to export from Figma Make" → I'll guide you through finding export

**C)** "Give me all files to copy manually" → I'll provide each file

**D)** "I found the export button!" → Great! Click it and download the ZIP

---

## 💡 **My Recommendation:**

**If you're on Mac/Linux:** Use Option 1 (auto setup script)
**If you're on Windows:** Tell me "Windows script" and I'll create one for you
**If you see an export button:** Use that! It's the fastest

## 📱 **After You Get The Files:**

1. **Open in VS Code:**
   ```bash
   code bidding-marketplace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for mobile:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The build output goes to `/dist` folder, ready for Android/iOS deployment!
